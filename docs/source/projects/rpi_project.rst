Automatic Entrance System with Raspberry Pi
====================================================================

In this project, we will use PIR to sense the movement of pedestrians, and use servos, LED, buzzer to simulate the work of the sensor door of the convenience store. When the pedestrian appears within the sensing range of the PIR, the indicator light will be on, the door will be opened, and the buzzer will play the opening bell.

    maxPW = (2.0 + myCorrection) / 1000  # Maximum pulse width
    minPW = (1.0 - myCorrection) / 1000  # Minimum pulse width

    # Initialize servo with custom pulse widths
    servoPin = Servo(25, min_pulse_width=minPW, max_pulse_width=maxPW)

    try:

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        # Clean up GPIO on user interrupt (e.g., Ctrl+C)
        buzPin.stop()
        ledPin.off()

After the code runs, if the PIR sensor detects someone passing by, the door will automatically open (simulated by the servo), turn on the indicator and play the doorbell music. After the doorbell music plays, the system will automatically close the door and turn off the indicator light, waiting for the next time someone passes by.
